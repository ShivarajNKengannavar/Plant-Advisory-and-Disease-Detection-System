## 💻 System Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Stable Internet (for weather/Gemini API)

---

## 🛡️ Notes

* The Gemini API is used securely with an `.env` file — do not hardcode your key.
* Images are not stored; only real-time inference is performed.
* All translations and weather queries are handled via free/public APIs.
* Chatbot falls back to a local model (ChatOllama) if Gemini fails.
